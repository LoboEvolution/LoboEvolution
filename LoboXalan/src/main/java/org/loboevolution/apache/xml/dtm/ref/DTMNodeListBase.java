/**
 * <code>DTMNodeList</code> gives us an implementation of the DOM's NodeList interface wrapped
 * around a DTM Iterator. The author considers this something of an abominations, since NodeList was
 * not intended to be a general purpose "list of nodes" API and is generally considered by the DOM
 * WG to have be a mistake... but I'm told that some of the XPath/XSLT folks say they must have this
 * solution.
 *
 * <p>Please note that this is not necessarily equivlaent to a DOM NodeList operating over the same
 * document. In particular:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If there are several Text nodes in logical succession (ie, across CDATASection and
 *       EntityReference boundaries), we will return only the first; the caller is responsible for
 *       stepping through them. (%REVIEW% Provide a convenience routine here to assist, pending
 *       proposed DOM Level 3 getAdjacentText() operation?)
 *   <li>Since the whole XPath/XSLT architecture assumes that the source document is not altered
 *       while we're working with it, we do not promise to implement the DOM NodeList's "live view"
 *       response to document mutation.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>State: In progress!!
