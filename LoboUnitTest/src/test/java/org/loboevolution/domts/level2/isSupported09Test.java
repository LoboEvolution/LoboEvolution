 * The "feature" parameter in the

 * of the feature and the version is the version number of the
 * feature to test.   XML is a legal value for the feature parameter
 * (Test for XML, upper case).

 * method is invoked with "feature" equal to "XML" and the version equal to 1.0.
 * The method should return a boolean "true".
