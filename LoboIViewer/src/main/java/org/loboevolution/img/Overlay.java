/**
 * An overlay is a layer on top of an image. It can be used to add annotations,
 * arbitrary shapes to an image. Drawing is implemented in the
 * paint method.
 * <p>
 * The following is an implementation of a simple example overlay that draws a
 * cross over the image:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * class XPainter extends Overlay {
 * 	public void paint(Graphics2D g, BufferedImage image, AffineTransform transform) {
 * 		g.setColor(Color.RED);
 * 		double[] bounds = { 0, 0, image.getWidth(), 0, image.getWidth(), image.getHeight(), 0, image.getHeight() };
 * 		transform.transform(bounds, 0, bounds, 0, 4);
 * 		g.drawLine((int) bounds[0], (int) bounds[1], (int) bounds[4], (int) bounds[5]);
 * 		g.drawLine((int) bounds[2], (int) bounds[3], (int) bounds[6], (int) bounds[7]);
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * It can be added to a viewer by calling
 * viewer.addOverlay(new XPainter(), 10).

	 * concatenation of a uniform scale and a translation. The original image bounds
	 * (0, 0) - (image.getWidth(), image.getHeight()) are mapped using this
	 * transformation to get the final display bounds. The overlay should not rely
	 * on whether painting outside these final bounds will be visible or not.
