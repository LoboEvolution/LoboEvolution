/**
 * A SMIL document is the root of the SMIL Hierarchy and holds the entire
 * content. Beside providing access to the hierarchy, it also provides some
 * convenience methods for accessing certain sets of information from the
 * document. Cover document timing, document locking?, linking modality and any
 * other document level issues. Are there issues with nested SMIL files? Is it
 * worth talking about different document scenarios, corresponding to differing
 * profiles? E.g. Standalone SMIL, HTML integration, etc.
