     * Simple objects are equal if their types and values
     * are the same. Strings are equal if their lengths and
     * individual elements are equal.
     *  Other composite objects
     * (arrays and dictionaries) are equal only if they share

     * same.
     * This operator performs some type conversions.
     * Integers and real numbers can be compared freely:
     * an integer and a real number representing the same
     * mathematical value are considered equal by eq.
     * Strings and names can likewise be compared freely:
     * a name defined by some sequence of characters is equal
     * to a string whose elements are the same sequence of
     * characters.
     * The literal/executable and access attributes of
     * objects are not considered in comparisons
     * between objects. <p>
