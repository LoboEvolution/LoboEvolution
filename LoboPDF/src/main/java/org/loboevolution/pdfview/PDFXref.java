/**
 * a cross reference representing a line in the PDF cross referencing
 * table.
 * <p>
 * There are two forms of the PDFXref, destinguished by absolutely nothing.
 * The first type of PDFXref is used as indirect references in a PDFObject.
 * In this type, the id is an index number into the object cross reference
 * table.  The id will range from 0 to the size of the cross reference
 * table.
 * <p>
 * The second form is used in the Java representation of the cross reference
 * table.  In this form, the id is the file position of the start of the
 * object in the PDF file.  See the use of both of these in the
 * PDFFile.dereference() method, which takes a PDFXref of the first form,
 * and uses (internally) a PDFXref of the second form.
 * <p>
 * This is an unhappy state of affairs, and should be fixed.  Fortunatly,
 * the two uses have already been factored out as two different methods.
